                        <p>
                            A website is a collection of interconnected webpages under one domain name. It can serve various purposes—eCommerce, portfolios, blogs, landing pages, and more.

                        <p>
                            A domain name is your site’s unique web address (e.g., www.yoursite.com). With any premium Website.com plan, you’ll receive a free domain, web hosting, and access to powerful design tools. While domain
                            registration typically incurs a fee, we cover that cost as part of our subscription plans.
